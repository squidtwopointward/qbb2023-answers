What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? Sample2?

To find the fraction of peaks, I would need to determine how many peaks are in each sample and the number of peaks that overlap with each other after interactions. 
Then calculate fractions of peaks retained by finding the number of peaks with interaction and divide that by the total number of peaks.
Do this for both samples and take the ratio of the two




How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?

I don't think everything will be completely consistent. I think the p value is a good indicative of relevance between the two samples but not necessarily for reproducibility. I think it can be reproducible if we release our code and allow for other scientist to pick and choose different region of interest.
