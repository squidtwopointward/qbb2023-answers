Step 1.1
1. How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?
*Number of reads = (1,000,000 Mbp * 3) / 100 bp = 30,000 reads

Step 1.3:

  In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
  *48625 with no coverage and 95.1375% of the genome not sequenced.
   
  How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
 * The poisson expectation fit, but the normal distribution did not fit. The line is all the way on the bottom of the graph hugging the zero axis  


Step 1.4 

    In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
    * 57 bases had 0x coverage and 99.9943% not sequenced
    
    How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
    * The poisson fits much better due to the increase lambda and the normal distribution I don't even see the line for the normal distribution, so it does not fit the data. 


Step 1.5

In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
* 99.9992% of the genome is not being sequenced and a total number of 8 bases with 0x coverage

How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
* Both the poisson expectations and the normal distribution fit on the graph
