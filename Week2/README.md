Step 1.1
1. How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?
*Number of reads = (1,000,000 Mbp * 3) / 100 bp = 30,000 reads

Step 1.3:

  In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
  *48625 with no coverage and 95.1375% of the genome not sequenced.
   
  How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
 * The poisson expectation fit, but the normal distribution did not fit. The line is all the way on the bottom of the graph hugging the zero axis  


Step 1.4 

    In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
    * 57 bases had 0x coverage and 99.9943% not sequenced
    
    How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
    * The poisson fits much better due to the increase lambda and the normal distribution I don't even see the line for the normal distribution, so it does not fit the data. 


Step 1.5

In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
* 99.9992% of the genome is not being sequenced and a total number of 8 bases with 0x coverage

How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
* Both the poisson expectations and the normal distribution fit on the graph


2.5
Assume that the maximum number of occurrences of any 3-mer in the actual genome is five. Using your graph from Step 2.4, write one possible genome sequence that would produce these reads
TATAT TTTCT TGTTT TCTTC ATGAC TTCAT GATTA


2.6
In a few sentences, what would it take to accurately reconstruct the sequence of the genome?
I think we would need more inputs for the sequence to be able to get the full genome

Exploring the Fascinating World of Genomics

Introduction

Genomics is a captivating field that has piqued my interest due to its profound implications for understanding life at its most fundamental level. The study of genomics delves into the intricate blueprint of life encoded within the DNA of organisms. In this essay, I will elucidate the reasons behind my keen interest in genomics, highlighting its vast potential for scientific advancements and its impact on various aspects of our lives.

Understanding the Blueprint of Life

Genomics provides a unique opportunity to unravel the intricacies of life. It allows us to decipher the genetic code that defines the characteristics and functions of every living organism. By investigating the structure and function of genes, we can gain invaluable insights into the mechanisms governing development, disease susceptibility, and evolutionary processes. This deeper understanding not only satisfies our innate curiosity but also holds the potential to transform fields such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.

Advancements in Medicine

One of the most exciting aspects of genomics is its impact on medicine. The Human Genome Project, a monumental scientific endeavor, paved the way for personalized medicine by mapping the entire human genome. Genomic information enables healthcare practitioners to tailor treatments to individual patients, optimizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing side effects. Furthermore, genomics plays a pivotal role in disease prevention and early diagnosis, as genetic markers can indicate predispositions to various illnesses. The potential for genomic medicine to revolutionize healthcare is staggering, with the promise of more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.

Agriculture and Food Security

Genomics is also indispensable in the realm of agriculture. By studying the genomes of crops and livestock, scientists can develop more resilient and productive strains, helping to address global food security challenges. Additionally, genomics allows for precise breeding programs, reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and promoting sustainable agriculture. The application of genomics in agriculture has the potential to alleviate hunger and reduce the environmental impact of food production.

Environmental Conservation

Genomics is not limited to human and agricultural applications; it extends to environmental conservation as well. By sequencing the genomes of endangered species, conservationists can develop strategies for preserving genetic diversity and preventing extinction. Genomic tools also aid in monitoring environmental changes and identifying organisms with unique properties, such as extremophiles, which could hold the key to solving environmental challenges or advancing biotechnology.

Conclusion

Genomics represents a captivating field with immense potential for scientific discovery and real-world applications. The study of genomics enables us to unlock the secrets of life, from understanding human biology at its core to addressing global challenges in medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation. As we continue to explore the genome's mysteries, genomics promises to shape the future in ways we are only beginning to comprehend. My interest in genomics stems from its capacity to push the boundaries of knowledge and make a tangible impact on the world around us, and I am eager to contribute to its ongoing exploration and development.


Step 3.2
Comment on the output from the LLM: Does it make logical sense? Does it include any phrases you would not have written? Do the cited papers exist and support the claims from the LLM?

It does make sense when you read the whole essay. It uses some phrases that I would use but only like 3 or so. All of the references to exist. I would have like newer publications but it did its job.
