Do these enrichments make sense to you? Are any surprising? Explain your reasoning briefly for each feature.
No these enrichments do not make sense to me, so therefore I can determine if this is surprising or not.

 Does it make sense for this gene to be interacting with enhancers in GM12878? Explain.
From what I see, I did not see any of the promoters/genes by the GM12878 so I can not say for 100 percent sure if these promoters interact with GM12878 if so I would see some TAD interactions or chromatin interaction. At this point, I cannot be sure and would need to do further investigating to fully answer if GW12878 interacts with other genes.
